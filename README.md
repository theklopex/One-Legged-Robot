# One-Legged-Robot
This is the source code for a one legged robot (2 servos) on an Arduino Mega 2560 R3.  This is the non-continuous version.

This is the first version of the one-legged-robot code.  This version tries to continuously move the two servos simultaneously.  This code is too complicated for STEM students to work with.
